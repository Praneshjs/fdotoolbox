v0.7.7
------

- Enhancements:
	- Re-implemented pre-0.6 missing features
		- When bulk copying from a source connection to a target connection and the target connection has no schemas defined, assumes all classes within are to be copied.
		- RunTask command for FdoUtil.exe
	- Support for Association and Object Properties in the Schema Editor
	- You can now run non-SELECT SQL queries in the Data Query View
	- Features that failed to be processed in an ETL task are now properly logged with exception details and a textual dump of that feature.
	- Custom drag and drop handler support. The following files can be dragged and dropped into FDO Toolbox
		- SDF, SHP and SQLite files
		- Feature Schema files
		- Saved Connection files
		- Bulk Copy Definitions

- Other:
	- Copy Spatial Context fixes for SQL Server 2008
	- Updated FDO 3.4 distribution. This should include an updated OGR provider with an important refcount fix.
	- Bulk copy fixes:
		- Now properly supports multi-class bulk copy
		- Can bulk copy computed expression properties
	- Invalid spatial context associations will be handled gracefully when a feature schema is loaded and applied (either set to the first spatial context or empty if no spatial contexts found)
	- Obfuscate protected properties in the connection tooltips. However this only obfuscates properties that FDO deems as protected. It will not obfuscate a password in a ODBC "ConnectinString" property for example.	

v0.7.5
------

- Enhancements:
	- Now uses FDO 3.4.0 final release.
	- CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) support. Be very careful with the Update and Delete functions. One false move and your data could be toast!
	- Bulk update support. Be VERY careful with this function! A false filter could cause irreversible changes to your data!
	- Bulk delete support. Be ESPECIALLY careful with this function! Words in all caps cannot emphasise the potential destruction wrought by this function!
	- Express support for SQL Server 2008 spatial.
	- Schema editor is now smarter in contextual mode. Will prevent you from adding most unsupported features.
	- Password properties are now properly masked in the Generic connect and create data store dialogs.

- Other:
	- ETL processes now gracefully continue on failed features.
	- ETL processes now log any errors encountered during execution.
    - Now a proper single-instance application. Subsequent attempts to launch a new process will instead re-focus the main application window.
	- Data Preview is now Data Query
	- Schema editor now reverts to using GeometricType instead of GeometryType, it will remain this way until FDO 3.5 enters beta.
	- RDBMS provider fixes for the Generic connect dialog.
	- Improved user documentation.
	- PostGIS express connect dialog now matches the MySQL one.

v0.7.1
------

- Enhancements:
	- Support for creating flat-file FDO data connections via drag and drop.
	- Add new "Copy Spatial Contexts" command, allowing you to copy spatial contexts from one connection to another.
	- Connection nodes in the Object Explorer now show all spatial contexts in tooltips
	- Improved bulk copy insert performance by using cached IInsert (and its PropertyValues) instead of FdoFeatureService.InsertFeature(). Performance gains are significant, for SQLite performance is *lightning* fast as opposed to dog-slow using the previous approach.
	- Add express module support for SQLite.
	- Add express connection support for the following providers: MySQL and PostGIS
	- Data Preview: Add SQLite output format.
	- Data Preview: Saved query results now have spatial context information included.
	- Saved connections and tasks should now be compatible with any FDO version, as version number strings are omitted from any provider names.

- Other:
	- Fixed crash in data preview when querying in standard mode without a geometry property specified.
	- Fix bulk copy property name mappings being ignored
	- Visual C++ 2008 CRT dlls bundled alongside FDO. This removes the VC++ 2008 runtime library requirement.
	- NSIS installer checks for .net Framework
	
v0.7.0
------

- Enhancements:
    - FdoFeatureService (formerly FeatureService) has been updated to take advantage of new APIs in FDO v3.4.x
	- Based on SharpDevelop Core, allowing for cleaner and simpler extensibility.
	- Helper macros for Generic Connect/Create datastore controls.
	- Refined Express Module
	- Refined Data Preview control. Select Aggregates is now fully featured unlike before.
	- Refined Schema Editor. This one is more simpler and can also function as a standalone editor.
	- Application Console can now be saved/cleared.
	- Added a text editor component (used by SharpDevelop). It currently serves no real purpose and is disabled for now.
	- Added a Preference UI extension API. To register and expose your preference UIs, implement IPreferenceSheet 
	  and specify the concrete type under the path "/FdoToolbox/Preferences" in your addin definition.
	- Express module now supports connecting to common ODBC formats (MS Access, Excel, SQL Server, Text files)
	- Express module now supports connecting to common OGR formats (currently: MapInfo, CSV and ESRI Personal Geodatabase)
	- Added ability to specify a configuration file for both generic and odbc express connection dialogs.
	- Revised ETL framework (based off Rhino ETL) is now fully implemented. All existing ETL functionality has been migrated over to this framework.
	- Added batch support for Database joins.
	- Data Preview: null values are displayed as <null> in the result grid
	
- Other:
	- FDO Toolbox is now distributed in the form of NSIS installer packages.
	- FDO Toolbox is now based on FDO v3.4.x. This means that providers that are not bundled will not work if they were built against FDO v3.3.x.
	- Nearly everything has been re-written from the ground up. 
	- Database/Non-spatial support has been dropped in favour of more specialized support for the ODBC provider.
	- Core API is now fully documented.

v0.6.0
------

- Enhancements:
	- Visual Preview of FDO data sources using the SharpMap library.
	- MapGuide Extension Module. This is experimental and work in progress.
	- Data Preview: You will be warned about potentially large query results sets being returned. If the number
	  of results exceeds the preference value of PREF_INT_WARN_DATASET, you will get this warning.
	- When bulk copying, the schema to be applied is checked for compatibility. If it is not compatible with
	  the target connection, the incompatibilities are displayed with the option to alter it to be compatible.
	
- Other:
	- Replaced MyMeta library with raw ADO.net for database introspection. As a result, there is a much
	  improved performance gain when creating non-spatial connections.
	- SQL Server 2008 bulk copy overrides
	- FDO Toolbox application specific elements have been removed from FdoToolbox.Core.dll and are now residing in its own
	  library - FdoToolbox.Base.dll
	- Added initial drop of a revised ETL API. This is an expermental API (still developing) and is not used by any FDO Toolbox classes. 
	  Eventually the existing ETL infrastructure will be deprecated and replaced with the revised API.
	- CHM-based user documentation. Currently this is just a skeleton. More content will arrive in future releases.
    - CHM-based API documentation. This covers the FdoToolbox.Core.dll assembly and is automatically generated by NDoc

v0.5.8
------

- Enhancements:
	- Data Preview: Data Query results can be saved to SDF (only in standard mode at the moment)
	- New FGF binary -> text parser in fully managed code (used by Data Preview) and certain ETL tasks.
	- New ad-hoc data entry form for inserting new feature data into feature classes.
	- Bulk Copy: Source properties can now be mapped to most target properties regardless of data type. 
	  This can naturally lead to data conversion errors as a result. These errors are logged during the bulk 
	  copy process.
    - New Preference variable: pref_str_log_path
    - Bulk Copy: The source schema is now validated against the target to see if it can be applied as is.
    
- Fix:
	- Prevent creation of zero-length string, BLOB and CLOB data properties.
	- Added mandatory check for Data Property name.
	- Data Preview: Computed properties did not show.
	
v0.5.6
------

- Enhancements:
	- Data Preview: Lifted feature limit and make loading of preview data run from a background worker thread.

- Fixes:
	- Fixed incorrect totals for certain bulk copy tasks.
	- Fixed UI text in the Express Bulk Copy control.
	- Fixed potential crash in Generic Connect/Create Data Store controls for certain providers.

v0.5.5
------

- Enhancements:
	- New "Remove All" command for:
		- FDO connections
		- ADO.net connections
		- Tasks
	- Non-Spatial data support: Copy database tables to Point Feature Classes.
	- Tasks and connections are persisted and restored on each session.
	- Data Preview: Filtering support for Select Aggregates
	- Save/Load support for non-spatial connections
	- XML schemas for configuration files
	- Bulk Copy: Support for batched insertions. Insert performance is better under batched mode (upwards of 10x faster in Oracle!), but this is not supported by all providers.
	
- Other:
	- Object explorer menu updates
	- Data Preview: Grid pane now resides in a tab.
	- Added a unit test suite. Not all tests currently pass, as they are still being implemented and retrofitted. 
	  Unit tests for the FDO API are *not* guaranteed to pass. Unit tests are only built in the debug configuration.

- Fixes:
	- Running tasks are now actually cancellable.
	- MySQL copy spatial context fixes.
	- Saving schema was saving with the schema name instead of the chosen file name.
	- Fixed incorrect property mapping in Bulk Copy Control.
	- Bulk Copy: Oracle-specific overrides
	- Bulk Copy: Improved counting process by avoiding the brute force approach if a faster alternative is available.
	- Bulk Copy: Fixed improper property/class mapping
	- Bulk Copy: If copying full schema, if any classes in it have no identity properties. An auto-generated property will be automatically created for it.

v0.5.0
------
- Enhancements:
	- Non-spatial data support.
		- Can create connections via OLEDB.
		- Can preview data via SQL.
		- Database Merge/Join Support.
			- Supported Join Types
				- Left Outer
				- Inner
			- Join Cardinalities
				- 1:1
				- 1:m
			- Please be aware of the following:
				- The target connection must support IApplySchema.
				- An auto-generated property will always be created on the target class
				- The FDO connection is always the "Left" side and the Database connection is always the "Right" side.
				- The target class is always created so it must not already exist.
				- A column prefix is required if there is a clash between property and column names. Validation will pick this up.
				- Properties which are also identity properties, can be copied over, but they won't be copied as identity properties to the joined feature class
	- New FdoUtil.exe commands: RegisterProvider and UnregisterProvider. Consult the updated cmd_readme.txt for details
	- FdoInfo.exe: Minor improvements in output display for ListClassProperties command.
	- New Preferences tab to edit preference dictionary values. Most preferences require an application restart to take effect.

- Other:
	- Major code/namespace re-structuring.
	
v0.4.2
------
- Enhancements:
	- General:
		- New per-class copy option: Delete before copy
			- Please be warned that deleting existing data may take a while. Only enable this option if necessary!
		- Added global spatial filter bulk copy option. This is a textual spatial filter that is applied to each feature class
		  that is being copied
			- eg. INSIDE GeomFromText('POLYGON XY ((-124.07 49.1, -124.07 49.2, -123.8 49.2, -123.8 49.1, -124.07 49.1))')
			- To migrate existing bulk copy definitions. Add a <GlobalSpatialFilter> element at the end of the <BulkCopyOptions> element.
		- New command-line utility: FdoInfo.exe. Consult the updated cmd_readme.txt for usage instructions.
		- New command: Class Data Preview. This basically loads the Data Preview tab, set to the selected schema/class
		- Expression Editor now supports building Spatial and Distance operations.
		- Data Preview in standard query mode now has support for property lists and computed fields.
		
- Fixes:
	- Small changes to extent labels in Spatial Context Dialog
	- Clicking cancel on the Generic Connect/Create Data Store tabs will now close them.
	- Fixed incorrect spatial context envelope computation for certain data sources.
	- Fixed error about missing table: Projections in cscatalog.sqlite
	- Connection-bound tabs are now single-instance (per connection). For example: that means you can't open the Schema Management
	  tab for <connection> more than once. Opening more than once will simply re-activate the existing tab.

- Other:
	- API name changes: Added a "Spatial" prefix to almost every class/property name starting with "Conn" as part of preparations for 
	  non-spatial data support

v0.4.1
------
- Enhancements:
	- General:
		- Added new per-class bulk copy option: Attribute filter
			- To migrate existing bulk copy task definitions. Add a <SourceFilter> element as the last child of each <Mapping> element.
		- Merged all command-line utilites into a single utility, FdoUtil.exe. Consult the updated cmd_readme.txt for usage details.
		- Support for external FDO installations. When FdoToolbox launches for the first time it will look for the "FDO" subdirectory. 
		  If this directory doesn't exist, you will be prompted to specify the directory containing the FDO binaries. After this the
		  directory will be written to a string preference pref_str_fdo_home. This value will be written to preferences.xml and used 
		  for every subsequent usage of FdoToolbox or its command-line utilities.
		- SchemaAttributeDictionary editing support for schemas and classes.
	    - Added context menus for schema and class nodes on the Object Explorer. 
- Fixes:
	- Expression Editor:
		- When in filter mode, "Validate Expression" now uses Filter.Parse() instead of Expression.Parse()

- Other:
	- Removed lots of redundant code by introducing a FeatureService API

v0.4.0
------
- Enhancements:
	- General:
		- A whole suite of command-line utilites have been included. For more information see cmd_readme.txt
		- Coordinate System Catalog. You can store and manage commonly-used coordinate systems.
			- The Spatial Context Dialog can now invoke a Coordinate System picker to auto-fill parts of the form.
			
- Other:
	- API change in ICopySpatialContextOverride
	- Removed capability check for the manschema command as the tab it displays is already capability-aware.

v0.3.5
------
- Enhancements:
	- General:
		- New program: TaskRun.exe, use it to load and execute task definitions from the command line
			- Usage: TaskRun.exe [task definition file]
			- Please be aware that both source and target connections must be valid. Otherwise the execution will fail.
		- Capability-aware menus. If a menu item is disabled, it means you can't run that command on the current selected connection because that provider doesn't support it!
		- Data Store Manager for rdbms-based providers
		- Bulk copy enhancements.
			- Added source spatial context list to Bulk Copy Control, so the user can specify up-front which ones to copy.
			- Saved definitions can now be fully executed without manual user input, provided both source and target connections are valid.
		- Added Console Application framework. TaskRun.exe is built on this framework.
- Fixes:
	- Save dialogs now work as before
	- Data Preview: Be more lenient with the case of SQL queries.

SVN changesets: r130 - r144

v0.3.4
------

- Enhancements:
	- General:
		- Added a preference dictionary. This gets loaded and saved to Preferences.xml on each
		session. If Preferences.xml is not found then a default one will be created on application exit.
	- Spatial Contexts
		- Can now auto-compute the extents from a list of chosen classes.
	- Schema Management
		- Can save selected schema to:
			- XML
			- Applied to a new SDF file
		- Geometric Property Definition dialog now uses GeometryType allowing for more geometry types.
	- Express Module
		- You can now create connections straight after creating SDF/SHP files.
		- You can name your connection after creating a SDF/SHP connection
- Other:
	- Class editing is re-activated. Be aware that deleting properties won't work at the moment.
	- FDO libraries now reside in their own subdirectory. This makes it easier to update the FDO libraries independent of FDO Toolbox.
- Fixes:
	- Closing the main application window (via clicking the [X]) will now trigger application shutdown. 
	- Tabs now close if the connection they are bound to is also closed.
	- Tabs will be renamed if the connection they are bound to is also renamed.
	- Can un-hide Object Explorer or Application Console if they were accidentally hidden.
- SVN changesets: r101 - r117
