The Object Explorer
===================

The **Object Explorer** is the heart of the FDO Toolbox application, it is the component that lets you manage (create / delete / rename) any type of object
and to perform certain tasks or operations on them. The Object Explorer handles the following types of objects:

 * FDO Connections
 * ETL Tasks
 
The Object Explorer can be extended to support additional types of objects and any commands and operations associated with these objects.
