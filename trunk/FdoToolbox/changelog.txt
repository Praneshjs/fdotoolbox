- Enhancements:
	- General:
		- New per-class copy option: Delete before copy
			- Please be warned that deleting existing data may take a while. Only enable this option if necessary!
		- Added global spatial filter bulk copy option. This is a textual spatial filter that is applied to each feature class
		  that is being copied
			- eg. "INTERSECTS GeomFromText('POLYGON XY ( 100 100, 0 100, 100 0, 0 0 )')
			- To migrate existing bulk copy definitions. Add a <GlobalSpatialFilter> element at the end of the <BulkCopyOptions> element.
		- New command-line utility: FdoInfo.exe. Consult the updated cmd_readme.txt for usage instructions.
		- New command: Class Data Preview. This basically loads the Data Preview tab, set to the selected schema/class
		- Expression Editor now supports building Spatial and Distance operations.
- Fixes:
	- Small changes to extent labels in Spatial Context Dialog
	- Clicking cancel on the Generic Connect/Create Data Store tabs will now close them.
	- Fixed incorrect spatial context envelope computation for certain data sources.
	- Fixed error about missing table: Projections in cscatalog.sqlite
	- Connection-bound tabs are now single-instance (per connection). For example: that means you can't open the Schema Management
	  tab for <connection> more than once. Opening more than once will simply re-activate the existing tab.

- Other:
	- API name changes: Added a "Spatial" prefix to almost every class/property name starting with "Conn" as part of preparations for 
	  non-spatial data support

v0.4.1
------
- Enhancements:
	- General:
		- Added new per-class bulk copy option: Attribute filter
			- To migrate existing bulk copy task definitions. Add a <SourceFilter> element as the last child of each <Mapping> element.
		- Merged all command-line utilites into a single utility, FdoUtil.exe. Consult the updated cmd_readme.txt for usage details.
		- Support for external FDO installations. When FdoToolbox launches for the first time it will look for the "FDO" subdirectory. 
		  If this directory doesn't exist, you will be prompted to specify the directory containing the FDO binaries. After this the
		  directory will be written to a string preference pref_str_fdo_home. This value will be written to preferences.xml and used 
		  for every subsequent usage of FdoToolbox or its command-line utilities.
		- SchemaAttributeDictionary editing support for schemas and classes.
	    - Added context menus for schema and class nodes on the Object Explorer. 
- Fixes:
	- Expression Editor:
		- When in filter mode, "Validate Expression" now uses Filter.Parse() instead of Expression.Parse()

- Other:
	- Removed lots of redundant code by introducing a FeatureService API

v0.4.0
------
- Enhancements:
	- General:
		- A whole suite of command-line utilites have been included. For more information see cmd_readme.txt
		- Coordinate System Catalog. You can store and manage commonly-used coordinate systems.
			- The Spatial Context Dialog can now invoke a Coordinate System picker to auto-fill parts of the form.
			
- Other:
	- API change in ICopySpatialContextOverride
	- Removed capability check for the manschema command as the tab it displays is already capability-aware.

v0.3.5
------
- Enhancements:
	- General:
		- New program: TaskRun.exe, use it to load and execute task definitions from the command line
			- Usage: TaskRun.exe [task definition file]
			- Please be aware that both source and target connections must be valid. Otherwise the execution will fail.
		- Capability-aware menus. If a menu item is disabled, it means you can't run that command on the current selected connection because that provider doesn't support it!
		- Data Store Manager for rdbms-based providers
		- Bulk copy enhancements.
			- Added source spatial context list to Bulk Copy Control, so the user can specify up-front which ones to copy.
			- Saved definitions can now be fully executed without manual user input, provided both source and target connections are valid.
		- Added Console Application framework. TaskRun.exe is built on this framework.
- Fixes:
	- Save dialogs now work as before
	- Data Preview: Be more lenient with the case of SQL queries.

SVN changesets: r130 - r144

v0.3.4
------

- Enhancements:
	- General:
		- Added a preference dictionary. This gets loaded and saved to Preferences.xml on each
		session. If Preferences.xml is not found then a default one will be created on application exit.
	- Spatial Contexts
		- Can now auto-compute the extents from a list of chosen classes.
	- Schema Management
		- Can save selected schema to:
			- XML
			- Applied to a new SDF file
		- Geometric Property Definition dialog now uses GeometryType allowing for more geometry types.
	- Express Module
		- You can now create connections straight after creating SDF/SHP files.
		- You can name your connection after creating a SDF/SHP connection
- Other:
	- Class editing is re-activated. Be aware that deleting properties won't work at the moment.
	- FDO libraries now reside in their own subdirectory. This makes it easier to update the FDO libraries independent of FDO Toolbox.
- Fixes:
	- Closing the main application window (via clicking the [X]) will now trigger application shutdown. 
	- Tabs now close if the connection they are bound to is also closed.
	- Tabs will be renamed if the connection they are bound to is also renamed.
	- Can un-hide Object Explorer or Application Console if they were accidentally hidden.
