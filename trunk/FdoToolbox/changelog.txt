v0.3.4
------

- Enhancements:
	- General:
		- Added a preference dictionary. This gets loaded and saved to Preferences.xml on each
		session. If Preferences.xml is not found then a default one will be created on application exit.
	- Spatial Contexts
		- Can now auto-compute the extents from a list of chosen classes.
	- Schema Management
		- Can save selected schema to:
			- XML
			- Applied to a new SDF file
		- Geometric Property Definition dialog now uses GeometryType allowing for more geometry types.
		- Re-Activated class editing. Removing properties does not work.
	- Express Module
		- You can now create connections straight after creating SDF/SHP files.
		- You can name your connection after creating a SDF/SHP connection
- Other:
	- Class editing is re-activated. Be aware that deleting properties won't work at the moment.
	- FDO libraries now reside in their own subdirectory. This makes it easier to update the FDO libraries independent of FDO Toolbox.
- Fixes:
	- Closing the main application window (via clicking the [X]) will now trigger application shutdown. 
	- Tabs now close if the connection they are bound to is also closed.
	- Tabs will be renamed if the connection they are bound to is also renamed.
	- Can un-hide Object Explorer or Application Console if they were accidentally hidden.
