#summary How to build FdoToolbox from source
#labels Featured

== Important ==

As of r1040, you will now need the .net Framework 3.5 or higher to build FDO Toolbox.

== Check out source from SVN ==

Follow the instructions in the "Source" tab of this project site.

== Requirements ==

In order to build the API documentation, you will need to download and install the [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=00535334-c8a6-452f-9aa0-d597d16580cc&displaylang=en HTML Help Workshop]

In addition, to build the User documentation, you will need [http://www.python.org Python] and [http://sphinx.pocoo.org Sphinx] installed.

== Building ==

To build FDO Toolbox run build.bat, the following options are available

{{{
build.bat [-h]
          [-t]
          [-v]
          [-c=BuildType]
          [-a=Action]

Help:          -h[elp]
Test:          -t[est]
Verbose:       -v
BuildType:     -c[onfig]=Release(default), Debug
Action:        -a[ction]=build(default), clean
}}}

When running build.bat with the -t switch, the unit tests will be built and run instead of the main source code.

To run the unit tests, do any of the following:

 * type: build.bat -t
 * type: nunit-console.exe TestLibrary.dll
 * load and run TestLibrary.dll in the NUnit GUI application.
 * run the TestRunner.exe application which will execute the unit tests. 

Additionally you can set the TestRunner project as the startup project to allow for debugging of unit tests.
