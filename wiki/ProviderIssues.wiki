#summary Quirks and Notes on various FDO providers


=== OSGeo.PostGIS ===

 * The provider is very unstable, any operations with a PostGIS connection may throw anything from win32 exceptions to System.AccessViolationException

 * Opening a bulk copy tab that involves a PostGIS connection may/will throw a System.AccessViolationException at OSGeo.FDO.Commands.BatchParameterValueCollection.ReleaseUnmanagedObject()

 * Changes made after applying a schema to a PostGIS connection are not visible until you remove and re-open the connection

=== OSGeo.OGR ===

 * Can get VC++ "pure virtual function calls" at random

=== OSGeo.KingOracle ===

 * SelectAggregate commands do not work because either the provider does not support them or the provide is falsely advertising that it does support it. ([http://trac.osgeo.org/fdo/ticket/376 Trac ticket 376])
