=== Q: I get errors bulk copying between different providers (when it attempts to apply the schema) ===

A: This is a current shortcoming of the bulk copy feature as various FDO providers do not necessary support the same set of data types. For example: MySQL supports Int64 auto-generated properties, trying to bulk copy MySQL to SDF with this property will fail as SDF does not support Int64 auto-generated properties.

Better warnings about incompatible schemas (with details about incompatible features) will definitely be in a future release. I am still figuring out the best way to resolve this issue in the most practical manner.

Update: Work is being done (Issue 114) to address this issue.

=== Q: I can't see schemas/classes in Oracle (using OSGeo.KingOracle) ===

A: When connecting to Oracle, leave the OracleSchema and KingFdoClass properties blank.

=== Q: Select Aggregates do not work in the Data Preview (using OSGeo.KingOracle) ===

A: The Data Preview's UI (and many others) are driven by the connection's capabilities, thus preventing you from doing illegal/unsupported actions. Basically [http://trac.osgeo.org/fdo/ticket/376 the provider is falsely reporting that Select Aggregates is supported, when it actually isn't]

=== Q: Does FDO Toolbox support creating Value Constraints for Data Properties? ===

=== Q: What is the difference between Lite and Full releases? ===

A: Lite releases do not include the FDO binaries, you will need the [http://fdo.osgeo.org FDO binaries]. You may be prompted for the directory containing the FDO binaries, this is a one-off thing.

=== Q: What is the release cycle for Lite and Full releases? === 

A: Every release will have a Lite version. Only major point releases (0.4, 0.5, ...) will have Full releases or when a newer version of FDO is released.

=== Q: Can I run FDO Toolbox in Linux (via Mono)? ===

A: No, as the FDO managed wrapper libraries are mixed-mode assemblies and Mono will most likely [http://www.jprl.com/Blog/archive/development/mono/2008/Jan-27.html never support the capability]. However certain parts of FDO Toolbox (such as command-line utilities) are on the roadmap to be ported to linux.
