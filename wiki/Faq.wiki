=== Q: I get errors bulk copying between different providers (when it attempts to apply the schema) ===

A: As of version 0.5.8, you will get a detailed explanation of why the source schema can not be applied to the target connection. With this information you can work around this error by re-creating the source schema on the target connection with the incompatible parts changed to parts supported by the target connection.

=== Q: I can't see schemas/classes in Oracle (using OSGeo.KingOracle) ===

A: When connecting to Oracle, leave the OracleSchema and KingFdoClass properties blank.

=== Q: Select Aggregates do not work in the Data Preview (using OSGeo.KingOracle) ===

A: The Data Preview's UI (and many others) are driven by the connection's capabilities, thus preventing you from doing illegal/unsupported actions. Basically [http://trac.osgeo.org/fdo/ticket/376 the provider is falsely reporting that Select Aggregates is supported, when it actually isn't]

=== Q: Does FDO Toolbox support creating Value Constraints for Data Properties? ===

A: Yes, this is currently in the trunk build and will be available in the next release.

=== Q: What is the difference between Lite and Full releases? ===

A: Lite releases do not include the FDO binaries, you will need the [http://fdo.osgeo.org FDO binaries]. You may be prompted for the directory containing the FDO binaries, this is a one-off thing.

=== Q: What is the release cycle for Lite and Full releases? === 

~~A: Every release will have a Lite version. Only major point releases (0.4, 0.5, ...) will have Full releases or when a newer version of FDO is released.~~

A: As of 0.7 all new releases will be full releases.

=== Q: Can I run FDO Toolbox in Linux (via Mono)? ===

A: No, as the FDO managed wrapper libraries are mixed-mode assemblies and Mono will most likely [http://www.jprl.com/Blog/archive/development/mono/2008/Jan-27.html never support the capability]. However certain parts of FDO Toolbox (such as command-line utilities) are on the roadmap to be ported to linux.

=== Q: Does FDO Toolbox work with FDO 3.4.0 weekly builds? ===

~~A: Ad-hoc testing (ie. Overwriting the FDO binaries with v3.4 ones) suggests that it does work. However it is recommended to only use the supported version of FDO (as of the most recent release, is v3.3.1)~~

A: Yes

=== Q: Are the APIs stable enough to develop extension modules against? ===

A: Until 1.0 is released, there is no guarantee that the current APIs will remain the same.
