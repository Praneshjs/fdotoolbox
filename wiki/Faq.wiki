=== Q: I get "Memory allocation failed" when previewing data ===

A: See Issue 21

=== Q: What is the difference between Lite and Full releases? ===

A: Lite releases do not include the FDO binaries, you will need to copy over binaries from a previous install of FDO Toolbox or from the [[http://fdo.osgeo.org FDO Project page]]. The
binaries must reside in the "FDO" sub-directory of the directory you extracted the lite release to.
