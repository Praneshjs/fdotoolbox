=== Q: What is the difference between Lite and Full releases? ===

A: Lite releases do not include the FDO binaries, you will need the [[http://fdo.osgeo.org FDO binaries]]. You may be prompted for the directory containing the FDO binaries, this is a one-off thing.

=== Q: What is the release cycle for Lite and Full releases? === 

A: Every release will have a Lite version. Only major point releases (0.4, 0.5, ...) will have Full releases or when a newer version of FDO is released.
