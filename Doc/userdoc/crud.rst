CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Operations
==============================================

FDO Toolbox supports CRUD operations. The level of support varies from provider to provider. Generally speaking:

 * Creating data is supported if the provider supports the ``IInsert`` FDO command.
 * Reading data is supported if the provider supports the ``ISelect`` FDO command.
 * Updating data is supported if the provider supports the ``IUpdate`` FDO command.
 * Deleting data is supported if the provider supports the ``IDelete`` FDO command.
